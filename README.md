# ORIGIANL README:

# CrossCode Element Boss

A conceptual boss design for CrossCode.

This is a CCLoader mod; if you don't already have CCLoader installed, grab it from here: https://github.com/CCDirectLink/CCLoader - then unpack this into new assets/mods/ directory in your CrossCode directory.

You can access the boss fight through a previously locked door in the northwest corner of Rhombus Square's South Arch map, and can refight the boss as many times as you'd like by leaving and re-entering the room. Step into the center of the arena to start the fight.

If you have questions, comments, or concerns, you can reach the author, sgrunt, on Discord in the CrossCode Discord server at http://discord.gg/crosscode.
